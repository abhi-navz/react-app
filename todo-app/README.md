# Todo Appliacation ( using React + Vite)


This is a simple yet functional Todo List web application built using React. The app allows users to add and manage their tasks with a user-friendly interface. Tasks can be added with titles and descriptions, and you can easily delete them when completed. The project showcases key React concepts, including functional components, state management with useState, form handling, conditional rendering, and event handling.
